##Project Description

This SQL project is designed to manage and analyze a hospital’s key operations, focusing on patient care, doctor appointments, treatments, and billing.

The database consists of five main tables:

•	Doctors – stores details about doctors such as their specialty, contact information, and unique IDs.

•	Patients – captures patient demographics and contact details.

•	Appointments – links patients and doctors while tracking appointment dates, times, reasons, and status.

•	Treatments – records diagnosis, treatment details, prescriptions, and treatment dates associated with specific appointments.

•	Billing – maintains payment records, including treatment costs, payment status, and billing dates.

This schema allows efficient storage and retrieval of hospital data, making it easier to schedule appointments, monitor treatments, and manage billing.
